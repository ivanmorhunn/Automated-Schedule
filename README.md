<h1>🗓️ Automated-Schedule</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
At my church we have an audio team, and I had the task of making a nice template so the guys could see their schedule. 
But instead of making boring dates and names, I decided to make an automatic schedule that would update every night.

<h2>🗒️ Features:</h2>

- Automatically highlights the next upcoming date
- Deletes all past dates
- Sorts all dates so that the earliest date is always at the top
- Updates every midnight

_You can simply make a copy of the template and modify it to your liking. Don't forget that the script needs the user's permission, because the script in order to work, it must have full access to the document._
