<h1>🗓️Automated-Schedule</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
At my church we have an audio team, and I had the task of making a nice template so the guys could see their schedule. 
But instead of making boring dates and names, I decided to make an automatic schedule that would update every night.

<h2>🗒️Features:</h2>

- Automatically highlights the next upcoming date
- Deletes all past dates
- Sorts all dates so that the earliest date is always at the top
